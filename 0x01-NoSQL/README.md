NOSQL means not SQL or not only SQL.NoSQL is particularly useful for storing unstructured data, which is growing far more rapidly than structured data and does not fit the relational schemas of RDBMS. NoSQL uses more flexible data models and it does not rely on the table, column, row, or schema structure to organize and retrieve data.
